## Francesco Romano's Page

This is my github page where I keep my projects (both finished and ongoing). The purpose is to have a single archive where everyone can look for a specific project. This is also linked on my Linkedin Profile and my Curriculum Vitae aka resume.

### Who am I?

I am a Data Scientist from Naples, Italy, I have developed a strong passion for statistics and coding, I like to apply what I have learned for daily life problems.
